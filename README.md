<h1>Java + Python Flask project</h1>

<h2>Java</h2>
I use maven to do API requests to a Bible API and gather data from it. We ask the user for input inside the Java console after running.
!NOTE
Make sure you have the Python Flask server running!

<h2>Python</h2>
We use Python Flask to accept the data gather from the Bible API and tranform it into a short video with an AI reading the quote picked from the bible.

<h2>To Run Project</h2>
To Run the Project install it from my github, set up the Java maven enviorment and the Python enviorment.
